## Handy Resources:

1. Rendering JSON in a notebook: [https://github.com/caldwell/renderjson](https://github.com/caldwell/renderjson)
2. JSON is the most common data serialization format you run into in data science. It's a simple way to pass data between servers, clients, programs, websites... all kind of things. It's the format of Jupyter notebooks and a way structured data can be represented as a Javascript Object. You don't really need to know a lot about it most of the time, but if you want to better understand it try:
  * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) 
  * [https://www.json.org](https://www.json.org)
3. YAML (rhymes with "camel") is another data serialization format. In classic computer science tradition the name is meant to be humorous; it stands for "YAML ain't markup language"). It's meant to be more human readable than JSON and is just a superset of JSON that gives importance to indentation and newlines in the style of Python. You see YAML used a lot to store configurations of programs.  For more info you can check out:

## Interesting Reading:

1.  JupyterCon is expensive, but a really fun way to see a lot of the Jupyter Landscape in one place. Here's an intriguing review: [http://willcrichton.net/notes/lessons-from-jupytercon/](http://willcrichton.net/notes/lessons-from-jupytercon/)
